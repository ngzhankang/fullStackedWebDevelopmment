#### Good Points

1. A dropdown list to let users choose between the venue instead of letting them tyoe themselves.
2. 4 different categories(filters) for the users to narrow down their selection.

#### Bad Points

1. Options for the users to choose the date and time is too small/ placed and squeezed at the top. Old/elder users who might not be tech-savvy or not alert might have accidentally skipped that part.
